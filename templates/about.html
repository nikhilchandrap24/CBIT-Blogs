          There are many aspects in student’s life where they jump into a situation in which they have no knowledge of. All the students require enough guidance to excel in their life. One such aspect is their career.
CBIT blogs is a website where students can read various blogs written by other students. The aim of our website is to share placement and internship experiences (archives) written by our own students to all the CBIT students. As a subsidiary, we also included various other categories where students can read the blogs written by their seniors or their fellow students. Our website will be an Experience-Hub for all the beginners who wish to improve their chances of getting placed in a good company. This idea was taken from my personal experiences where I need to depend upon my seniors, asking them their placement/internship experiences. 
We would like to express our sincere gratitude and indebtedness to our project guide and mentor B. Ramadasu Sir who have supported us throughout our project with patience and knowledge and guided us with valuable inputs and suggestions. We are also thankful to Head of the department Dr. Y. Rama Devi ma’am, for providing excellent infrastructure and a conducive atmosphere for completing this project successfully.
